module_speaker_id.py

Passive Speaker Identification Module for TARS-AI.

Uses sherpa-onnx WeSpeaker embedding model to extract voice embeddings
from utterances and match them against enrolled speakers. Runs as a
background observer thread — never blocks the STT → LLM pipeline.

Speaker vectors are stored in a JSON-based Voice Memory file. Identification
uses cosine similarity with a recency-biased confidence window. Unknown
speakers are dynamically enrolled after multiple consistent samples.

    Voice Memory:
        Enrolled speakers are stored in a JSON file with their name and

        Uses cosine similarity against enrolled speakers. If confidence > threshold
        within a recent time window, the speaker is assumed to be that person.
        Results are exposed via current_speaker for LLM prompt injection.
