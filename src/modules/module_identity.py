"""
module_identity.py

Identity Coordinator for TARS-AI.

Cross-references speaker identification (voice) and face recognition (vision)
to produce a unified identity context for the LLM prompt and memory tagging.

Voice identification determines "who is speaking" (authoritative).
Face recognition provides "who is present" (supplementary context).

Degrades gracefully: works with voice-only, face-only, or both.
